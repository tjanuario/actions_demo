# This workflow expects will run automatically when a PR is created, updated, or synchronized
# OR when manually triggered by "terraform plan" / "terraform apply" issue comments.
# It first determines the (Terraform) files that have been modified, creates a matrix of
# corresponding Terraform root module directories (workspaces), and runs the terraform plan
# and/or apply cycle operations for each root module that has been added/changed.
